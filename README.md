This is a simple, clean **Reels Style Video Project** built with HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript. The goal of this project is to clone a common social media design into accessible, modern code â€” and make it easy for anyone to customize or learn from. Itâ€™s mobile responsive and includes an accessibility focus.

_This project is free and open-source, and focused on helping new frontend developers practice HTML, CSS and JavaScript with real-world examples._
